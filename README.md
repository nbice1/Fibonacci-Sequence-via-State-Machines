# Fibonacci-Sequence-via-State-Machines
Here we use state machines to compute the Fibonacci sequence. 

To compute the Fibonacci sequence using this program, run the program and print (fib.run(n)), where n is the number of elements of the sequence you wish to compute. See comments in the code for details on how this is accomplished via state machines.
